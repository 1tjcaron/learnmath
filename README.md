*Guiding Students with the SimpleCues Chatbot*

To learn independently, students with disabilities need repetitive cueing and teacher created content online, which they donâ€™t have access to today.  Our tool gives students access to grade-level curriculum through a chatbot and consistent reference tools.

Please see our [Project Description](https://devpost.com/software/test-1u6dmk) for a deep look into this project.

This project is deployed to https://learnmath2.azurewebsites.net/.  Go see if you can pass our problem sets!

Want to get in touch?
We'd love to take any feedback you have, and we are looking for new classrooms with beta users who could make use of teacher-encoded cueing. Please reach out at SimpleCues at outlook dot com!
